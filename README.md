# GamesLogger
Web app built in vanilla JavaScript for logging video games you've played along with some details about each one. This was my first project and was created roughly 6 weeks into my learning journey.


You can click 'New Game' on the front page to log a new entry.

You can click 'Load Game' on the front page to load all previous entries.

Clicking the 'GamesLogger' header text will always return you to the front page.
